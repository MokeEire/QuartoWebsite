    "text": "Singular elements\nIn the bookstore example, each of the book’s children were singular, which means they are well suited to be flattened into a dataframe. In the congressional data, we’ll need to single out the singular elements like billNumber and billType before converting to a dataframe. To do this, I find nodes which meet two criteria: 1) the node does not have any child elements, and 2) the node is not an empty string.\nxml_find_all() extracts nodes based on an XPath (XML Path Language) string and returns an {xml_nodeset} which can be coerced to a list using as_list(). As the function’s help file says, “XPath is like regular expressions for trees”. When writing an XPath expression, you are selecting the nodes which match the given pattern. In this case //bill/* selects all the child nodes in a bill node, while the text [ within the square brackets ] indexes these nodes to select those which have no children using the XPath function count and nodes which are not empty strings8.\n\nCodesingular_nodes = xml_find_all(\n  bill_xml, \n  \"//bill/*[count(./*) = 0 and not(string-length(.) = 0)]\"\n  )\n\n(singular_list = as_list(singular_nodes)) %>% \n  glimpse()\n\nList of 10\n $ :List of 1\n  ..$ : chr \"391\"\n $ :List of 1\n  ..$ : chr \"2021-01-22T08:12:10Z\"\n $ :List of 1\n  ..$ : chr \"2022-02-09T12:37:52Z\"\n $ :List of 1\n  ..$ : chr \"House\"\n $ :List of 1\n  ..$ : chr \"HR\"\n $ :List of 1\n  ..$ : chr \"2021-01-21\"\n $ :List of 1\n  ..$ : chr \"117\"\n $ :List of 1\n  ..$ : chr \"<pre>[Congressional Record Volume 167, Number 17 (Thursday, January 28, 2021)][House]From the Congressional Rec\"| __truncated__\n $ :List of 1\n  ..$ : chr \"Global Health Security Act of 2021\"\n $ :List of 1\n  ..$ : chr \"1.0.0\"\n\n\nNote that we didn’t retain the element names so we need to assign them ourselves.

    "section": "Nested elements",
    "text": "Nested elements\nIt’s nice when things are simple, but often times they’re not. In congressional data, three such cases are: elements with multiple children, elements with multiple children with their own sub-elements, and elements with nested XML data.\nwe might want to know what happened to the bill over time – when it was introduced, voted on, and/or passed. Each of these could be represented as a column representing the date of the action like introducedDate, but this becomes unruly as the different action types and characteristics increase. Below is an example of an individual action element.\n\nCodeactions_xml = xml_find_all(bill_node, \"actions/item\")\n\n# Look at first action\nxml_contents(actions_xml[1])\n\n{xml_nodeset (6)}\n[1] <actionDate>2021-07-12</actionDate>\n[2] <committees>\\n  <item>\\n    <systemCode>ssfr00</systemCode>\\n    <name>Fo ...\n[3] <links/>\n[4] <sourceSystem>\\n  <code>0</code>\\n  <name>Senate</name>\\n</sourceSystem>\n[5] <text>Received in the Senate and Read twice and referred to the Committee ...\n[6] <type>IntroReferral</type>\n\n\nTo include actions and votes, we can take advantage of the nest()/unnest() functionality of tidyr. We use the same steps as before to convert the XML to a list and then nest them in a list column.\nMultiple children\nMultiple children with sub-elements\nThe actions node has an <item> child node for each congressional action taken for a bill, such as being introduced, sent to a committee, debated on the floor, etc.. Just as before, we use as_list() to convert the {xml_nodeset} to a list.\n\nCodeactions_list = as_list(actions_xml)\n\n# Look at first action\nglimpse(actions_list[[1]])\n\nList of 6\n $ actionDate  :List of 1\n  ..$ : chr \"2021-07-12\"\n $ committees  :List of 1\n  ..$ item:List of 2\n  .. ..$ systemCode:List of 1\n  .. ..$ name      :List of 1\n $ links       : list()\n $ sourceSystem:List of 2\n  ..$ code:List of 1\n  .. ..$ : chr \"0\"\n  ..$ name:List of 1\n  .. ..$ : chr \"Senate\"\n $ text        :List of 1\n  ..$ : chr \"Received in the Senate and Read twice and referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\"\n $ type        :List of 1\n  ..$ : chr \"IntroReferral\"\n\n\nIn the individual action container, we can see we have the type, text, and date of the action, a list of committees related to the action, and some elements which are singular and some which are not. To deal with this, we can write a function (or set of functions) like the ones below to process an action.\n\nView Functions# Helper function: flatten_dfc_rename\n# flatten a list to dataframe and \n# rename the columns with a given prefix\nflatten_dfc_rename = function(list_to_flatten, \n                          name_prefix = \"prefix\"){\n  rename_with(\n    .data = flatten_dfc(list_to_flatten), \n    .fn = ~str_c(name_prefix, \"_\", .),\n    # Exclude columns which already start with the prefix\n    .cols = -starts_with(name_prefix)\n    )\n}\n\n# Function: parse_action\n# Parse actions from list to dataframe\nparse_action = function(action){\n  action %>% \n    # Flatten+rename sourceSystem elements\n    map_at(\"sourceSystem\", ~flatten_dfc_rename(.x, \"source\")) %>% \n    # Flatten+rename committees\n    map_at(\"committees\", function(committee){\n      map_dfr(committee, ~flatten_dfc_rename(.x, \"committee\"))\n    }) %>% \n    # Flatten object to dataframe\n    flatten_dfc_rename(., \"action\") %>% \n    # Lastly, clean the names\n    janitor::clean_names()\n}\n\n\nUsing the purrr library’s map_dfr(), we apply this function to each action and combine the results into dataframe rows.\n\nCode# Parse the first action\nparse_action(actions_list[[1]]) %>% \n  glimpse()\n\nRows: 1\nColumns: 7\n$ action_date                  <chr> \"2021-07-12\"\n$ action_committee_system_code <chr> \"ssfr00\"\n$ action_committee_name        <chr> \"Foreign Relations Committee\"\n$ action_source_code           <chr> \"0\"\n$ action_source_name           <chr> \"Senate\"\n$ action_text                  <chr> \"Received in the Senate and Read twice an…\n$ action_type                  <chr> \"IntroReferral\"\n\n\nIt is useful to be explicit about the data types when you plan to combine rows into a dataframe or unnest() the data in the future. I do this using type_convert() to ensure the columns have a specific datatype. To add these actions data as a list column to bill_df we can simply use dollar assignment.\n\nCodeactions_df = map_dfr(actions_list, parse_action)\n\nactions_df = type_convert(actions_df,\n                          col_types = cols(\n                            action_date = col_date(), \n                            action_time = col_time(),\n                            action_committee_systemCode = col_character(), \n                            action_committee_name = col_character(), \n                            action_source_code = col_character(),\n                            action_source_name = col_character(),\n                            action_text = col_character(), \n                            action_type = col_character(), \n                            action_code = col_character()\n                            )\n                          )\n\nbill_df$actions = list(actions_df)\n\n\nNested XML\nVotes are particularly interesting because it provides a more discrete measure of our representatives’ behaviour. Individual votes are stored in the <recordedVotes> container.\n\nCode(bill_recorded_vote_nodes = xml_find_all(bill_node, \"recordedVotes/recordedVote\")) %>% \n  xml_contents()\n\n{xml_nodeset (7)}\n[1] <rollNumber>188</rollNumber>\n[2] <url>https://clerk.house.gov/evs/2021/roll188.xml</url>\n[3] <fullActionName>Final Passage Under Suspension of the Rules Results</full ...\n[4] <chamber>House</chamber>\n[5] <congress>117</congress>\n[6] <date>2021-06-28T23:46:02Z</date>\n[7] <sessionNumber>1</sessionNumber>\n\n\nYou may have spotted why votes are interesting elements to parse because inside the <url> element we find another XML file!9 Before we dive into that can of worms, I’ll convert the top-level nodes to a list and flatten it into columns. Note we use map_dfr() with votes_list because there could be multiple vote objects.\n\nCode# Coerce nodes to list\nrecorded_votes_list = as_list(bill_recorded_vote_nodes)\n\n(recorded_votes_df = map_dfr(recorded_votes_list, flatten_dfc)) %>% \n  glimpse()\n\nRows: 1\nColumns: 7\n$ rollNumber     <chr> \"188\"\n$ url            <chr> \"https://clerk.house.gov/evs/2021/roll188.xml\"\n$ fullActionName <chr> \"Final Passage Under Suspension of the Rules Results\"\n$ chamber        <chr> \"House\"\n$ congress       <chr> \"117\"\n$ date           <chr> \"2021-06-28T23:46:02Z\"\n$ sessionNumber  <chr> \"1\"\n\n\nNow we want to get the vote roll XML file, so we go back to read_xml() . There are two main nodes - <vote-metadata> and <vote-data>. One node contains the aggregated vote information, while <vote-data> contains the legislator-level vote data. Let’s try to parse the legislator-level data first. Here is the XML for a single legislator’s vote:\n\nCodevote_roll_xml = read_xml(recorded_votes_df$url)\n\nvote_data = xml_find_all(vote_roll_xml, \"vote-data\")\n\nvote_legislators = vote_data %>% \n  xml_find_all(\"recorded-vote\")\n\n(legislators_list = as_list(vote_legislators))[1] %>% \n  glimpse()\n\nList of 1\n $ :List of 2\n  ..$ legislator:List of 1\n  .. ..$ : chr \"Adams\"\n  .. ..- attr(*, \"name-id\")= chr \"A000370\"\n  .. ..- attr(*, \"sort-field\")= chr \"Adams\"\n  .. ..- attr(*, \"unaccented-name\")= chr \"Adams\"\n  .. ..- attr(*, \"party\")= chr \"D\"\n  .. ..- attr(*, \"state\")= chr \"NC\"\n  .. ..- attr(*, \"role\")= chr \"legislator\"\n  ..$ vote      :List of 1\n  .. ..$ : chr \"Yea\"\n\n\nWith a similar combination of as_list() , flatten_dfr(), and unnest() we can flatten the XML into one row per legislator but we lose all the attributes.\n\nCode(vote_roll_flattened = vote_data %>% \n  as_list() %>% \n  flatten_dfr() %>% \n    unnest(everything()))\n\n# A tibble: 430 × 2\n   legislator  vote \n   <chr>       <chr>\n 1 Adams       Yea  \n 2 Aderholt    Nay  \n 3 Aguilar     Yea  \n 4 Allen       Nay  \n 5 Allred      Yea  \n 6 Amodei      Yea  \n 7 Armstrong   Yea  \n 8 Arrington   Nay  \n 9 Auchincloss Yea  \n10 Axne        Yea  \n# … with 420 more rows\n\n\nInstead we’ll need to extract the attributes before we flatten the data. We want to extract the attributes only for legislator using map() to apply map_at() on each legislator element and extract the attributes from each while retaining the value in vote. It can often feel like you’re getting lost in a list of lists, but with some experimentation you’ll be able to find your way back to the surface.\n\nCode(legislator_vote_df = legislators_list %>% \n    # Modify one level deeper using map_at to target legislator elements\n    map(map_at, \"legislator\", attributes) %>% \n    map_dfr(flatten_dfc))\n\n# A tibble: 430 × 7\n   `name-id` `sort-field` `unaccented-name` party state role       vote \n   <chr>     <chr>        <chr>             <chr> <chr> <chr>      <chr>\n 1 A000370   Adams        Adams             D     NC    legislator Yea  \n 2 A000055   Aderholt     Aderholt          R     AL    legislator Nay  \n 3 A000371   Aguilar      Aguilar           D     CA    legislator Yea  \n 4 A000372   Allen        Allen             R     GA    legislator Nay  \n 5 A000376   Allred       Allred            D     TX    legislator Yea  \n 6 A000369   Amodei       Amodei            R     NV    legislator Yea  \n 7 A000377   Armstrong    Armstrong         R     ND    legislator Yea  \n 8 A000375   Arrington    Arrington         R     TX    legislator Nay  \n 9 A000148   Auchincloss  Auchincloss       D     MA    legislator Yea  \n10 A000378   Axne         Axne              D     IA    legislator Yea  \n# … with 420 more rows\n\n\nNow we have a table of legislator voting data! But what about the <vote-metadata>? Everything other than the <vote-totals> element is singular so we can get that out of the way the same way as before:\n\nCodevote_metadata = xml_find_all(vote_roll_xml, \"vote-metadata\")\n\nvote_singular_nodes = xml_singular_nodes(vote_metadata)\n\n(vote_df = as_list(vote_singular_nodes) %>% \n  # as_list() doesn't retain element names so we set names ourselves\n  setNames(xml_name(vote_singular_nodes)) %>% \n  flatten_dfc()) %>% \n  glimpse()\n\nRows: 1\nColumns: 12\n$ majority        <chr> \"D\"\n$ congress        <chr> \"117\"\n$ session         <chr> \"1st\"\n$ chamber         <chr> \"U.S. House of Representatives\"\n$ `rollcall-num`  <chr> \"188\"\n$ `legis-num`     <chr> \"H R 391\"\n$ `vote-question` <chr> \"On Motion to Suspend the Rules and Pass, as Amended\"\n$ `vote-type`     <chr> \"2/3 YEA-AND-NAY\"\n$ `vote-result`   <chr> \"Passed\"\n$ `action-date`   <chr> \"28-Jun-2021\"\n$ `action-time`   <chr> \"7:42 PM\"\n$ `vote-desc`     <chr> \"Global Health Security Act\"\n\n\nThe <vote-totals> are a bit of a unique little element, with 3 different types of nodes. This is another opportunity for us to be choosy with our data. The first node is table headers, which we don’t need because the elements are tagged anyway.
