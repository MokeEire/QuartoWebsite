    "text": "Meanwhile, our information systems have become heavily dependent on social media platforms corporations which explicitly do not have responsibility for content posted on their platforms. That is not to say they should bear this responsibility, because that would likely lead to overly-conservative censorship of content to avoid litigation. But when misinformation is proliferating on platforms, the founder of Facebook is pleading for Congress to step in, and legislators are demonstrating a profound lack of expertise in the technologies at hand, we need to improve the decisions being made in one or both of these institutions.\nInstitutional decision-making is vague so it is important to clarify what is meant by institutions and decision-making. I borrow definitions from the Effective Institutions Project because they do an excellent job balancing comprehensiveness with brevity.\n\nThe definition of an institution is not completely standardized across disciplines or academic fields, but in this context we mean a formally organized group of people, usually delineated by some sort of legal entity (or an interconnected set of such entities) in the jurisdiction(s) in which that group operates.\n\n\n…when we speak of “decision-making,” we are using that term broadly to refer to all of the aspects of the process leading up to an institution’s actions over which that institution has agency.\n\nSo put together, it means we want to understand the processes of a (usually) legal entity for achieving its aims. In the case of governments, these aims are usually to provide a safe, economically viable state for its citizens and residents, while corporations are usually required to deliver as much value to shareholders as possible.\nConsidering what an institution actually intends to do is related to the first of two pathways defined by the Effective Institutions Project for improving institutional decision-making. It is particularly important that powerful institutions, whose decisions can have broad second- and third-order consequences, are driven to improve global outcomes and factor in the scope of their impact beyond the likely more narrow set of interests that determine their actions. Once an institution at least has aims which are consistent with improving global outcomes, the next step is to understand the effectiveness of their process for achieving their aims.\nThis is where behavioural science comes in. The last five decades of behavioural science research has been ground-breaking to say the least. Researchers have identified how errors occur in our decision-making, how different contexts affect our thinking, and what this actually means for criminal justice outcomes, hiring decisions, and many more. For most institutions, the processes in place to achieve their intended outcomes necessarily involve human judgement, intuition, and group decision-making, which likely introduces a variety of errors in judgement.\nIn the face of challenges as complex and structurally interdependent as climate change and AI safety, we need institutions driven by holistic, altruistically-defined aims, and which are designed to effectively achieve those aims. Using research from behavioural science to inoculate and support decision-making from biases and judgement errors could enhance our problem-solving capacity for issues from pandemic response preparedness to political gridlock.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder Construction\n\n\n\nMore to come soon."

If you have worked with XML before, you’ll know it can be a bit of a pain to transform into a tabular format typically used in data analysis. The good news is you’re not alone!

    "text": "Convert an XML nodeset to a data frame\nWhen converting XML into a data frame, one of the simplest cases to deal with is a set of nodes which each have a single value. You can think of singular nodes as the contents of a single cell in a data frame. When your data are entirely made up of nodes like this, you can convert XML to a data frame using two functions from XML:\n\nxmlParse() parses an XML file into an R structure9 representing the XML tree\nxmlToDataFrame() extracts data from an XML document directly into a data frame, but with limited flexibility\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn the example below, we need to use getNodeSet(., [path =] \"//bill\") to select only nodes in <bill>. If we just passed bill_xml_parse, we would get a dataframe with two rows because the top-level nodes are bill and the metadata identifier node <dublinCore>.\n\n\n\nCode# First we need to use xmlParse function to create XMLDocument object\nbill_xml_parse = xmlParse(bill_xml)\n\nxmlToDataFrame(getNodeSet(bill_xml_parse, \"//bill\")) %>% \n  glimpse()\n\nRows: 1\nColumns: 28\n$ billNumber                           <chr> \"391\"\n$ createDate                           <chr> \"2021-01-22T08:12:10Z\"\n$ updateDate                           <chr> \"2022-09-07T13:37:22Z\"\n$ originChamber                        <chr> \"House\"\n$ billType                             <chr> \"HR\"\n$ introducedDate                       <chr> \"2021-01-21\"\n$ congress                             <chr> \"117\"\n$ constitutionalAuthorityStatementText <chr> \"<pre>[Congressional Record Volum…\n$ recordedVotes                        <chr> \"188https://clerk.house.gov/evs/2…\n$ committees                           <chr> \"ssfr00Foreign Relations Committe…\n$ committeeReports                     <chr> \"\"\n$ relatedBills                         <chr> \"\"\n$ actions                              <chr> \"2021-07-12ssfr00Foreign Relation…\n$ sponsors                             <chr> \"C001078Rep.

When parsing nested XML like this, it might require multiple steps to get the data into a tidy data frame.\nIn this case, the first step is to isolate singular elements like billNumber and billType, and deal with nested elements individually afterwards.\nSingular elements are nodes which meet two criteria:\n\nthe node does not have any child nodes of its own, and\nthe node is not an empty string.\n\nWe can use xml_find_all() to filter an XML document with XPath (XML Path Language). The XPATH expression selects the nodes which match the given path or pattern10 in a similar way as regular expressions. As the function’s help file says, “XPath is like regular expressions for trees”.\nIn the code below the [ expressions within the square brackets ] are called predicates which I use to find nodes which have no children with the XPath count function and nodes which are not empty strings11. This returns an {xml_nodeset} which can be coerced to a list using as_list().\n\nCodesingular_nodes = xml_find_all(bill_xml, \n                              # //bill/* selects the child nodes in a bill\n                              \"//bill/*[count(./*) = 0 and not(string-length(.) = 0)]\")\n\n(singular_list = as_list(singular_nodes)) %>% \n  glimpse()\n\nList of 10\n $ :List of 1\n  ..$ : chr \"391\"\n $ :List of 1\n  ..$ : chr \"2021-01-22T08:12:10Z\"\n $ :List of 1\n  ..$ : chr \"2022-09-07T13:37:22Z\"\n $ :List of 1\n  ..$ : chr \"House\"\n $ :List of 1\n  ..$ : chr \"HR\"\n $ :List of 1\n  ..$ : chr \"2021-01-21\"\n $ :List of 1\n  ..$ : chr \"117\"\n $ :List of 1\n  ..$ : chr \"<pre>[Congressional Record Volume 167, Number 17 (Thursday, January 28, 2021)][House]From the Congressional Rec\"| __truncated__\n $ :List of 1\n  ..$ : chr \"Global Health Security Act of 2021\"\n $ :List of 1\n  ..$ : chr \"1.0.0\"\n\n\nNow that we have the data we want in a list, we can flatten each element in the list into a data frame column using purrr’s flatten_dfc(). However, notice the elements in a singular_list are not named. If we flatten this list to a data frame, our columns also won’t have any column names. We can use xml_name() to create a character vector of the nodes’ names in combination with setNames() to create a named list. Just make sure singular_list and singular_nodes are the same length and in the same order.\n\nCodesingular_list_named = setNames(singular_list, \n                                xml_name(singular_nodes))\n\n\nWhen flattened, a named list becomes a data frame with column names in tow.\n\nCode(bill_df = flatten_dfc(singular_list_named)) %>% \n  glimpse()\n\nRows: 1\nColumns: 10\n$ billNumber                           <chr> \"391\"\n$ createDate                           <chr> \"2021-01-22T08:12:10Z\"\n$ updateDate                           <chr> \"2022-09-07T13:37:22Z\"\n$ originChamber                        <chr> \"House\"\n$ billType                             <chr> \"HR\"\n$ introducedDate                       <chr> \"2021-01-21\"\n$ congress                             <chr> \"117\"\n$ constitutionalAuthorityStatementText <chr> \"<pre>[Congressional Record Volum…\n$ title                                <chr> \"Global Health Security Act of 20…\n$ version                              <chr> \"1.0.0\"\n\n\nWith the singular nodes transformed, we have the base of our data frame. The next step is to choose a nested element, define its structure in the output, and transform the XML accordingly."

To deal with this, we can write a function (or set of functions) like the ones below to transform actions from a list to a data frame with their own nested elements.\n\nView Functions# Helper function: flatten_dfc_rename\n# flatten a list to data frame and \n# rename the columns with a given prefix\nflatten_dfc_rename = function(list_to_flatten, \n                          name_prefix = \"prefix\"){\n  rename_with(\n    .data = flatten_dfc(list_to_flatten), \n    .fn = ~str_c(name_prefix, \"_\", .),\n    # Exclude columns which already start with the prefix\n    .cols = -starts_with(name_prefix)\n    )\n}\n\n# Function: parse_action\n# Parse actions from list to data frame\nparse_action = function(action){\n  action %>% \n    # Flatten + rename sourceSystem elements\n    map_at(\"sourceSystem\", ~flatten_dfc_rename(.x, \"source\")) %>% \n    # Flatten + rename committees\n    map_at(\"committees\", function(committee){\n      # using map_at and map_dfr to create a data frame row for each committee\n      map_dfr(committee, ~flatten_dfc_rename(.x, \"committee\"))\n    }) %>% \n    # Flatten object to data frame\n    flatten_dfc_rename(., \"action\") %>% \n    # Lastly, clean the names\n    janitor::clean_names()\n}\n\n\nUsing the purrr library’s map_dfr(), we apply this function to each action and combine the results into data frame rows. Here’s the output of this process:\n\nCode# Parse the first action\n(actions_df = map_dfr(actions_list, parse_action)) %>% \n  glimpse()\n\nRows: 14\nColumns: 9\n$ action_date                  <chr> \"2021-07-12\", \"2021-06-28\", \"2021-06-28\",…\n$ action_committee_system_code <chr> \"ssfr00\", NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA,…\n$ action_committee_name        <chr> \"Foreign Relations Committee\", NA, NA, NA…\n$ action_source_code           <chr> \"0\", \"2\", \"2\", \"9\", \"2\", \"2\", \"2\", \"2\", \"…\n$ action_source_name           <chr> \"Senate\", \"House floor actions\", \"House f…\n$ action_text                  <chr> \"Received in the Senate and Read twice an…\n$ action_type                  <chr> \"IntroReferral\", \"Floor\", \"Floor\", \"Floor…\n$ action_time                  <chr> NA, \"19:46:03\", \"19:46:02\", \"19:46:02\", \"…\n$ action_code                  <chr> NA, \"H38310\", \"H37300\", \"8000\", \"H30000\",…\n\n\nWhen you plan to combine rows into a data frame or unnest() the data in the future, it is useful to be explicit about the expected data types of each column. This can be done using type_convert(). Because we are only adding a single row of data to bill_df we can encase the actions in a list and use dollar assignment.

There are two main nodes - <vote-metadata> and <vote-data>. One node contains the aggregated vote information, while <vote-data> contains the legislator-level vote data. Let’s parse the legislator-level data first. Here is the XML for a single legislator’s vote:\n\nCodevote_roll_xml = read_xml(recorded_votes_df$url)\n\nvote_data = xml_find_all(vote_roll_xml, \"vote-data\")\n\nvote_legislators = vote_data %>% \n  xml_find_all(\"recorded-vote\")\n\n(legislators_list = as_list(vote_legislators))[1] %>% \n  glimpse()\n\nList of 1\n $ :List of 2\n  ..$ legislator:List of 1\n  .. ..$ : chr \"Adams\"\n  .. ..- attr(*, \"name-id\")= chr \"A000370\"\n  .. ..- attr(*, \"sort-field\")= chr \"Adams\"\n  .. ..- attr(*, \"unaccented-name\")= chr \"Adams\"\n  .. ..- attr(*, \"party\")= chr \"D\"\n  .. ..- attr(*, \"state\")= chr \"NC\"\n  .. ..- attr(*, \"role\")= chr \"legislator\"\n  ..$ vote      :List of 1\n  .. ..$ : chr \"Yea\"\n\n\nWith a similar combination of as_list() , flatten_dfr(), and unnest() we can flatten the XML into one row per legislator but we lose all the attributes.\n\nCode(vote_roll_flattened = vote_data %>% \n  as_list() %>% \n  flatten_dfr() %>% \n    unnest(everything()))\n\n# A tibble: 430 × 2\n   legislator  vote \n   <chr>       <chr>\n 1 Adams       Yea  \n 2 Aderholt    Nay  \n 3 Aguilar     Yea  \n 4 Allen       Nay  \n 5 Allred      Yea  \n 6 Amodei      Yea  \n 7 Armstrong   Yea  \n 8 Arrington   Nay  \n 9 Auchincloss Yea  \n10 Axne        Yea  \n# … with 420 more rows\n\n\nInstead we’ll need to extract the attributes before we flatten the data. We want to extract the attributes only for legislator using map() to apply map_at() on each legislator element and extract the attributes from each while retaining the value in vote. It can often feel like you’re getting lost in a list of lists, but with some experimentation you’ll be able to find your way back to the surface.\n\nCode(legislator_vote_df = legislators_list %>% \n    # Modify one level deeper using map_at to target legislator elements\n    map(map_at, \"legislator\", attributes) %>% \n    map_dfr(flatten_dfc))\n\n# A tibble: 430 × 7\n   `name-id` `sort-field` `unaccented-name` party state role       vote \n   <chr>     <chr>        <chr>             <chr> <chr> <chr>      <chr>\n 1 A000370   Adams        Adams             D     NC    legislator Yea  \n 2 A000055   Aderholt     Aderholt          R     AL    legislator Nay  \n 3 A000371   Aguilar      Aguilar           D     CA    legislator Yea  \n 4 A000372   Allen        Allen             R     GA    legislator Nay  \n 5 A000376   Allred       Allred            D     TX    legislator Yea  \n 6 A000369   Amodei       Amodei            R     NV    legislator Yea  \n 7 A000377   Armstrong    Armstrong         R     ND    legislator Yea  \n 8 A000375   Arrington    Arrington         R     TX    legislator Nay  \n 9 A000148   Auchincloss  Auchincloss       D     MA    legislator Yea  \n10 A000378   Axne         Axne              D     IA    legislator Yea  \n# … with 420 more rows\n\n\nNow we have a table of legislator voting data! But what about the <vote-metadata>? Everything other than the <vote-totals> element is singular so we can get that out of the way the same way as before:\n\nCodevote_metadata = xml_find_all(vote_roll_xml, \"vote-metadata\")\n\nvote_singular_nodes = xml_singular_nodes(vote_metadata)\n\n(vote_df = as_list(vote_singular_nodes) %>% \n  # as_list() doesn't retain element names so we set names ourselves\n  setNames(xml_name(vote_singular_nodes)) %>% \n  flatten_dfc()) %>% \n  glimpse()\n\nRows: 1\nColumns: 12\n$ majority        <chr> \"D\"\n$ congress        <chr> \"117\"\n$ session         <chr> \"1st\"\n$ chamber         <chr> \"U.S. House of Representatives\"\n$ `rollcall-num`  <chr> \"188\"\n$ `legis-num`     <chr> \"H R 391\"\n$ `vote-question` <chr> \"On Motion to Suspend the Rules and Pass, as Amended\"\n$ `vote-type`     <chr> \"2/3 YEA-AND-NAY\"\n$ `vote-result`   <chr> \"Passed\"\n$ `action-date`   <chr> \"28-Jun-2021\"\n$ `action-time`   <chr> \"7:42 PM\"\n$ `vote-desc`     <chr> \"Global Health Security Act\"\n\n\nThe <vote-totals> are a bit of a unique little element, with 3 different types of nodes. This is another opportunity for us to be choosy with our data. The first node is table headers, which we don’t need because the elements are tagged anyway. From these, we really only need the <totals-by-party> nodes as long as the totals of which agree with <totals-by-vote> , which is worth checking.\n\nCode(vote_totals = xml_find_all(vote_metadata, \"vote-totals\")) %>% \n  xml_contents()\nvote_totals_by_party = xml_find_all(vote_totals, \"totals-by-party\")\n\nparty_vote_totals_df = as_list(vote_totals_by_party) %>% \n  map_dfr(flatten_dfc) %>% \n    type_convert()\n\n(totals_by_vote = xml_find_all(vote_totals, \"totals-by-vote\")) %>% \n  xml_contents()\n\n\n\n{xml_nodeset (5)}\n[1] <totals-by-party-header>\\n  <party-header>Party</party-header>\\n  <yea-he ...\n[2] <totals-by-party>\\n  <party>Republican</party>\\n  <yea-total>90</yea-tota ...\n[3] <totals-by-party>\\n  <party>Democratic</party>\\n  <yea-total>217</yea-tot ...\n[4] <totals-by-party>\\n  <party>Independent</party>\\n  <yea-total>0</yea-tota ...\n[5] <totals-by-vote>\\n  <total-stub>Totals</total-stub>\\n  <yea-total>307</ye ...\n\n\n{xml_nodeset (5)}\n[1] <total-stub>Totals</total-stub>\n[2] <yea-total>307</yea-total>\n[3] <nay-total>112</nay-total>\n[4] <present-total>0</present-total>\n[5] <not-voting-total>11</not-voting-total>\n\n\n\n\nOnce we have our nodeset (which at last are all singular), we use the same listing, mapping, and flattening…or lappening as absolutely no one calls it.\nNow that we have all of our vote data wrangled from the thorny grasp of XML, we can put it all together and nest it until we’ve gotten back to the bill-level i.e. the vote roll data frame goes in the votes data frame, which goes in the bill data frame.\n\nCodevote_roll_df = vote_df %>% \n  mutate(legislator_votes = list(legislator_vote_df),\n         party_votes = list(party_vote_totals_df)) %>% \n    janitor::clean_names()\n\n(recorded_votes_df = recorded_votes_df %>% \n  mutate(vote_roll = list(vote_roll_df))) %>% \n  glimpse()\n\nRows: 1\nColumns: 8\n$ rollNumber     <chr> \"188\"\n$ url            <chr> \"https://clerk.house.gov/evs/2021/roll188.xml\"\n$ fullActionName <chr> \"Final Passage Under Suspension of the Rules Results\"\n$ chamber        <chr> \"House\"\n$ congress       <chr> \"117\"\n$ date           <chr> \"2021-06-28T23:46:02Z\"\n$ sessionNumber  <chr> \"1\"\n$ vote_roll      <list> [<tbl_df[1 x 14]>]\n\nCodebill_df$votes = list(recorded_votes_df)\n\n\nNow we have the bill-level characteristics with action and vote information nested in list columns. If we want to analyze the actions data, we simply have to unnest() it.\n\nCodeunnest(bill_df, actions) %>% \n  glimpse()\n\nRows: 14\nColumns: 20\n$ billNumber                           <chr> \"391\", \"391\", \"391\", \"391\", \"391\"…\n$ createDate                           <chr> \"2021-01-22T08:12:10Z\", \"2021-01-…\n$ updateDate                           <chr> \"2022-09-07T13:37:22Z\", \"2022-09-…\n$ originChamber                        <chr> \"House\", \"House\", \"House\", \"House…\n$ billType                             <chr> \"HR\", \"HR\", \"HR\", \"HR\", \"HR\", \"HR…\n$ introducedDate                       <chr> \"2021-01-21\", \"2021-01-21\", \"2021…\n$ congress                             <chr> \"117\", \"117\", \"117\", \"117\", \"117\"…\n$ constitutionalAuthorityStatementText <chr> \"<pre>[Congressional Record Volum…\n$ title                                <chr> \"Global Health Security Act of 20…\n$ version                              <chr> \"1.0.0\", \"1.0.0\", \"1.0.0\", \"1.0.0…\n$ action_date                          <date> 2021-07-12, 2021-06-28, 2021-06-…\n$ action_committee_system_code         <chr> \"ssfr00\", NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA,…\n$ action_committee_name                <chr> \"Foreign Relations Committee\", NA…\n$ action_source_code                   <chr> \"0\", \"2\", \"2\", \"9\", \"2\", \"2\", \"2\"…\n$ action_source_name                   <chr> \"Senate\", \"House floor actions\", …\n$ action_text                          <chr> \"Received in the Senate and Read …\n$ action_type                          <chr> \"IntroReferral\", \"Floor\", \"Floor\"…\n$ action_time                          <time>       NA, 19:46:03, 19:46:02, 19…\n$ action_code                          <chr> NA, \"H38310\", \"H37300\", \"8000\", \"…\n$ votes                                <list> [<tbl_df[1 x 8]>], [<tbl_df[1 x …\n\n\nI’ll stop there for brevity’s sake, but you can find the code for extracting the full XML file here13."
