I am an analyst with a passion for behavioural science, public policy, and R. 
The purpose of this website is to build a data analysis portfolio and write about policy issues that matter to me.

I am interested in **decision-making**, **governance institutions**, and **information systems**, and particularly where these topics overlap.
