title: "About me"
---

I am a researcher, data analyst, behavioural science nerd, and visualization designer.

My interests include **decision-making**, **governance institutions**, and **information systems**, and particularly areas where these topics coincide.

This website is intended to showcase the kind of analysis I like to do, and how I like to do it.

Some questions that are of particular interest to me:

-   Are the structures and processes of policy-making institutions conducive to effective, informed, and equitable judgements?

-   What factors in our society and policies perpetuate poverty?

-   How can public and private institutions foster an information system which enables society to develop a shared consensus of facts on issues central to public well-being?
