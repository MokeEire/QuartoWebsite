I am a senior data analyst with experience developing analytic tools and supporting policy research. I want to build a high-impact career that addresses the pressing problems in our world by improving the decision-making processes and structures of important institutions around the world. 

While at the RAND Corporation, I developed decision-making analytics tools, streamlined data collection methods, and analyzed survey data for research projects on Truth Decay, criminal justice, and education.

After my time in policy research, I looked for a role in data analytics to use my experience in behavioural science and technical skills to improve organizationsâ€™ decision-making through by making data accessible and understandable. 

Over the past 3 years I have led projects evaluating data quality, estimating marketshare, and enhancing collaboration between analytics and other departments. My work has strengthened the decision-making capacity of senior leadership by providing powerful interactive dashboards to inform key decisions across organizations.
