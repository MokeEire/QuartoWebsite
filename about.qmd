I am a senior data analyst with experience developing analytic tools and supporting policy research. 
I want to build a high-impact career that addresses pressing problems in the world by improving decision-making processes and structures of institutions using evidence-based insights. 

While at the RAND Corporation, I developed decision-making analytics tools, streamlined data collection methods, and analyzed survey data for research projects on Truth Decay, criminal justice, and education. I learned the rigour of program evaluations, analytical research, and developed proficiency in numerous data science tools including R, SQL, and Python. 

Over the past 3 years I have lead projects mapping and analyzing organizational processes and delivered behaviourally-informed solutions to structural and operational "data problems" that arise throughout the analytics process. 
I have been using Tableau, SQL, and R to provide effective visualizations, rigorous analysis, and automate tasks like data cleaning,

I am looking to bring my policy expertise and data skills to an organization that is aware of its social impact and actively seeks to improve it.
