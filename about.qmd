I am a senior data analyst, with experience developing analytic tools and supporting policy research.
I am hooked on the idea that thoughtful use of data analytics and behavioural science can improve the everyday decision-making of individuals and institutions.
While at the RAND Corporation, I developed decision-making analytics tools, streamlined data collection methods, and analyzed survey data for research projects on Truth Decay, criminal justice, and education. 
The feeling that my work was contributing to the world around me, even through the often diffuse mechanisms of research, was a potent driver and frequently a catalyst of flow.

After my time at RAND, I had planned to pursue a Masters in economics in Europe, but as the school year approached I began to feel this was not the right path for me.
Living in the Los Angeles rental market, I needed to find a job fairly quickly to keep afloat.
I knew I was good at data analysis and enjoyed programming so I decided to look for a role in data analytics.
I wanted to combine my analytics skills with my background in behavioural science to make data accessible to decision-makers and improve organizations' decision-making processes.
Over the past `r round(lubridate::time_length(lubridate::today() - lubridate::ymd("2020-01-31"), unit = "year"))` years I have led projects evaluating data quality, strengthened the decision-making capacity of senior leadership by building powerful interactive dashboards, and enhanced collaboration between analytics and other departments by coordinating analytics working groups.

While I enjoy working on analytics problems, I have not found the same level of fulfilment I found working in policy research.
I knew wanted to build a high-impact career that contributes to pressing problems in our world, in particular the structures and processes of institutions' decision-making.
I struggled to put my ambitions into words until I stumbled across [80,000 Hours](https://80000hours.org/).
Reading through their [key ideas](https://80000hours.org/key-ideas/) and listening to hours of the [80,000 Hours podcast](https://80000hours.org/podcast/) cemented my goal of using my career to make a difference.
