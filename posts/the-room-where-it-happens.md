The laws that govern our lives are typically made by a body of legislators known as a legislature.
Legislatures differ in structure, functions, and usually go by names such as parliament, national assembly, or congress.
If you live in a democracy, these legislators are meant to produce laws representative of the interests of the population.
The decision-making process of government officials and representatives can be a little opaque. 
While in the US the legislation process was immortalized in animation in 1976 with [schoolhouse rock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyeJ55o3El0), legislation can follow very different paths today.

The basic steps for a bill takes to become law are:

1. Bill is drafted
2. Bill is introduced
3. Bill goes to committee
4. Bill is debated on congress floor
5. Bill is voted on by congress

*Decision-making* needs to be evaluated at each stage of the policy process - from conceptualization to implementation.
Identifying the role of context, judgement heuristics, and subsequent noise in decisions that influence policies is vital to understanding and improving the capacity for effective problem-solving in public policy.  
We have little reason to believe that *governance institutions* are designed in such a way as to ensure accurate and efficient decision-making, and sparse evidence to assess the quality of these institutions' decisions.  
Modern *information systems* have developed more quickly than research can discern the societal consequences of these developments and more quickly than legislators can enact policies to ensure a safe and equitable information environment.
This problem is amplified by the role the information systems have been playing in politics, affecting both the incentives and beliefs of legislators and voters alike.
