Using [RShiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) and PostgreSQL, my friend and I created an app that allows us to track games and player performance in one of our favourite juvenile activities - snappa. Over the past 5 years, my friends and I developed our own variation of the relatively popular drinking game [beer die](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_die) (or *snappa*). Our rules encourage more active, coordinated, and generally more impressive plays, which we think make it a much better game.

This app tracks the round, various scoring events, and aggregates player and game-level statistics for information on our performance. It has been a fantastic project to learn how to manage a database, build an interactive application, and develop UI and UX that takes user behaviour into account.
