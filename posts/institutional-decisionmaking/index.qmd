How can we best spend our time and energy in ways that improve the world?
I have been, and still am, grappling with this question for a while now and I have to say - it's a toughie.
Working to mitigate (and now adapt to) climate change is a clear front runner to consider, but the levers of power for reducing emissions and switching to clean energy can't really be budged by individual action.
Another issue that is front of mind is the myriad of increasing inequalities that are being cultivated by the economic and political systems at hand.
Housing has become a fundamental tool for powerful corporations and home-owning individuals to accrue wealth.
Tech companies like Airbnb have made this tool more powerful and further entrenched the idea that the purpose of housing was to provide wealth, not shelter.
When we account for the costs of a system enabling the powerful to extract increasing amounts of money from less powerful individuals, the housing market seems quite inefficient.
Problems like these are exacerbated by the fact that powerful economic actors (individuals and corporations with lots of money) can use this power to influence powerful political actors (the people who make our laws) to protect or entrench their economic power.
Why does Intuit , a company that earns money automating tax collection, spend millions of dollars on lobbying?
Why does the IRS require manual tax collection unlike most developed nations?

Improving the decision-making of powerful institutions may be one of the most consequential endeavors of the 21st century.
Institutions are vital levers of change for our most pressing challenges from mitigating climate change to ensuring the safe and ethical development of artificial intelligence.
It is important that these institutions' goals are aligned with better global outcomes and that their decision-making processes are effective in achieving their aims.

# What is institutional decision-making?

Institutional decision-making is vague so it is important to clarify what is meant by *institutions* and *decision-making*.
I borrow definitions from the [Effective Institutions Project](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ttpSEgE3by7AAhQ7w/improving-institutional-decision-making-which-institutions-a#Background) because they do an excellent job balancing comprehensiveness with brevity.

> The definition of an **institution** is not completely standardized across disciplines or academic fields, but in this context we mean *a formally organized group of people, usually delineated by some sort of legal entity (or an interconnected set of such entities) in the jurisdiction(s) in which that group operates*.

> ...when we speak of "**decision-making**," we are using that term broadly to refer to *all of the aspects of the process leading up to an institution's actions over which that institution has agency*.

So put together, it means we want to understand the processes of a (usually) legal entity for achieving its aims.
In the case of governments, these aims are usually to provide a safe, economically viable state for its citizens and residents, while corporations are usually required to deliver as much value to shareholders as possible.

# What does it mean to improve institutional decision-making?

Considering what an institution actually *intends* to do is related to the first of two pathways defined by the Effective Institutions Project for improving institutional decision-making.
It is particularly important that powerful institutions, whose decisions can have broad second- and third-order consequences, are driven to improve global outcomes and factor in the scope of their impact beyond the likely more narrow set of interests that determine their actions.
Once an institution at least has aims which are consistent with improving global outcomes, the next step is to understand the effectiveness of their process for achieving their aims.

This is where behavioural science comes in.
The last five decades of behavioural science research has been ground-breaking to say the least.
Researchers have identified how errors occur in our decision-making, how different contexts affect our thinking, and what this actually means for criminal justice outcomes, hiring decisions, and many more.
For most institutions, the processes in place to achieve their intended outcomes necessarily involve human judgement, intuition, and group decision-making, which likely introduces a variety of errors in judgement.

In the face of challenges as complex and structurally interdependent as climate change and AI safety, we need institutions driven by holistic, altruistically-defined aims, and which are designed to effectively achieve those aims.
Using research from behavioural science to inoculate and support decision-making from biases and judgement errors could enhance our problem-solving capacity for issues from pandemic response preparedness to political gridlock.

# How will it help?

## Climate Change

Almost all options for mitigating climate change face institutional barriers and the feasibility of these solutions depends on institutions' ability to effectively enact policy.
To reduce global emissions to a level that prevents 1.5C warming above pre-industrial levels, we need national and international institutions to co-ordinate and act effectively [@shukla2022summary].
Importantly, national governments should be evaluating how their emissions have compared to the targets set at previous climate talks and identifying why (in the majority of cases) the country did not achieve their climate goals.
If making such costly decisions in the face of global health and economic crises is not palatable to politicians focused on re-election, perhaps political institutions need to be examined.

AI research labs must ensure that our understanding of AI ethics and safety are sufficient to prevent an AI from developing beyond our control, but this is both less exciting and less profitable.

## Information Systems

Meanwhile, social media platforms have become of our information systems on corporations which explicitly do not have responsibility for content posted on their platforms.
That is not to say they should bear this responsibility, because that would likely lead to overly-conservative censorship of content to avoid litigation.
But when misinformation is proliferating on platforms, the founder of Facebook is pleading for Congress to step in, and legislators are demonstrating a profound lack of expertise in the technologies at hand, we need to improve the decisions being made in one or both of these institutions.
