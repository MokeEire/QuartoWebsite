It is designed to contain any \"arbitrary\" structure[^1] of data which makes it useful for storing things like financial transactions, webpage content and document formatting[^2]. Whenever I've worked with XML in the past, there seemed to be a dearth of resources describing how to actually transform the data into something usable. This post aims to remedy that by describing how to parse an XML file from [GovInfo's congressional bill data](https://www.govinfo.gov/bulkdata/BILLSTATUS).\n\n[^1]: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) for the curious. Don't miss the drama about Microsoft's \"vociferous protests\" as one of the co-editors started working with Netscape.\n\n[^2]: The *x* at the end of Microsoft file types (e.g. .docx, .xlsx, .pptx) stands for XML.\n\n::: {.callout-tip appearance=\"simple\"}\n## What you'll learn:\n\n1.  Load and parse XML files in R using the `{XML}` and `{xml2}` packages\n2.  Explore the structure of XML documents\n3.  Transform your data from XML into a tabular format using `{purrr}`, and make use of `{tidyr}`'s list columns\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\" appearance=\"simple\"}\n## TL;DR\n\nTransforming XML into a tabular format can be tricky depending on the structure. Start by understanding how the data is organized, what you want it to look like, and what level of detail you are looking at. This post uses [GovInfo's congressional bill data](https://www.govinfo.gov/bulkdata/BILLSTATUS) to explore examples of XML structure.\n\n1.  [Navigate XML](#sec-navigate-xml)\n\n> Look through any available documentation, always. When you read in the XML file, `xmlParse()`, `xml_structure()`, and `xml_contents()` are some of the functions that will help you navigate the structure you're dealing with.\n\n2.  [**Define the output**]\n\n> Consider what you want the output to look like and think about how the data needs to be transformed to match this. Once you understand the existing structure, the data you need, and your desired output structure, it is time to start parsing.\n\n3.  [**Parse a single element**] (write a function if it gets too complicated)\n\n> Get one element into the form you want first. Writing functions can help you think through the data transformations being applied and make your code easier to read. You can see an example of this functional approach in [parsing legislative actions](#sec-nested-data). Once you're reliably parsing multiple elements and producing a consistent output format, you can scale up.\n\n4.  **Apply to all elements**\n\n> Next, focus on processing a single file in full (or the subset of the file you're interested in). You might want an XML file to return a single row, a single column, or a data frame of size $n\\times k$. Once you have a single file returned in the format you want, you can combine the outputs of all the files in your dataset.\n:::\n\n# What is XML?\n\nAt its core, XML is \"information wrapped in tags\". You can think of the structure like branches of a tree, with each branch having their own leaves. Below is an example of a bookstore's data in XML format from [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/XML/xml_usedfor.asp).\n\n``` xml\n<bookstore>\n  <book category=\"children\">\n    <title>Harry Potter</title>\n    <author>J K. Rowling</author>\n    <year>2005</year>\n    <price>29.99</price>\n  </book>\n  <book category=\"web\">\n    <title>Learning XML</title>\n    <author>Erik T. Ray</author>\n    <year>2003</year>\n    <price>39.95</price>\n  </book>\n</bookstore>\n```\n\n`<bookstore>` is the parent, or *root* element here. The two `<book>` elements are the bookstore's *children*, each of which has individual data points in *child* elements (e.g. `<title>`) and *attributes* e.g. `<book category=\"children\">` store books' category.\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Note\n\nAttributes are a useful way to store data related to a specific element for HTML, but using child elements is typically preferred in XML[^3]. However, you'll still likely run into data stored in attributes so we'll touch on extracting data from both.\n:::\n\n[^3]: To learn more about what XML is and how to use it, I recommend going through [w3school's XML tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/XML/default.asp).\n\n# Navigate XML {#sec-navigate-xml}\n\nIf you've never used R before, this will be a bit of a rough point to start learning. Instead I would recommend checking [RStudio's beginners guide](https://education.rstudio.com/learn/beginner/), so for the remainder of the post I will assume some familiarity with R.\n\nFour packages I use throughout this post are listed below. If you don't understand how a function works or want to see the function reference, click on the function in the code and it *should* bring you to the function's help page.\n\n-   `{XML}` and `{xml2}` provide functions for reading in and parsing XML[^4]\n\n-   `{purrr}` and `{tidyr}` (loaded as part of the `{tidyverse}` package) help us wrangle lists and transform XML to data frames.\n\n[^4]: Between `{XML}` and `{xml2}` there are numerous ways to load XML data with R. I generally prefer `{xml2}` but I suggest looking through the packages' documentation to find the right function for your task\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"show\" code-summary=\"Load libraries\"}\n# copy the comment below to install the packages\n# install.packages(c(\"tidyverse\", \"XML\", \"xml2))\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(XML)\nlibrary(xml2)\n```\n:::\n\n\nTo illustrate complexities of XML structures I'll be using [congressional bill status data](https://www.govinfo.gov/bulkdata/BILLSTATUS) from the US GPO's [GovInfo service](https://www.govinfo.gov/). In particular, you can download the sample bill [here](https://www.govinfo.gov/bulkdata/BILLSTATUS/117/hr/BILLSTATUS-117hr391.xml \"HR-391: Global Health Security Act of 2021\") (chosen for its examples of challenges parsing XML).\n\nFirst we need to read in the XML file. You can pass the URL or file path of the XML file to `read_xml()` to create an `xml_document` object[^5]. To see the contents of the file you've just loaded you can use `xml_contents()` or enter the object's name (here `bill_xml`) in the console.\n\n[^5]: `xml_document` is one of the \"key classes\" used in the `{xml2}` library, the others being `xml_node` (a single node), and `xml_nodeset` (a set of nodes).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"show\" code-summary=\"Load and view XML file\"}\n# Read XML file\nbill_xml = read_xml(\"https://www.govinfo.gov/bulkdata/BILLSTATUS/117/hr/BILLSTATUS-117hr391.xml\")\n\n# Look at xml_document's contents\nxml_contents(bill_xml)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n{xml_nodeset (2)}\n[1] <bill>\\n  <billNumber>391</billNumber>\\n  <createDate>2021-01-22T08:12:10 ...\n[2] <dublinCore xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">\\n  <dc:format>te ...\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe have two top-level nodes - `<bill>` and `<dublinCore>`[^6]. The latter is actually a metadata identifier and doesn't contain bill-related information. `xml_child()` selects the `<bill>` node which returns an XML nodeset that looks like this:\n\n[^6]: Which is a document metadata identifier, not an Irish metal music genre. While very useful in its own right, it isn't relevant for our task here.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"show\" code-summary=\"Select first matching child element\"}\n(bill_node = xml_child(bill_xml, \"bill\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n{xml_node}\n<bill>\n [1] <billNumber>391</billNumber>\n [2] <createDate>2021-01-22T08:12:10Z</createDate>\n [3] <updateDate>2022-09-07T13:37:22Z</updateDate>\n [4] <originChamber>House</originChamber>\n [5] <billType>HR</billType>\n [6] <introducedDate>2021-01-21</introducedDate>\n [7] <congress>117</congress>\n [8] <constitutionalAuthorityStatementText><![CDATA[<pre>[Congressional Recor ...\n [9] <recordedVotes>\\n  <recordedVote>\\n    <rollNumber>188</rollNumber>\\n    ...\n[10] <committees>\\n  <billCommittees>\\n    <item>\\n      <systemCode>ssfr00</ ...\n[11] <committeeReports/>\n[12] <relatedBills/>\n[13] <actions>\\n  <item>\\n    <actionDate>2021-07-12</actionDate>\\n    <commi ...\n[14] <sponsors>\\n  <item>\\n    <bioguideId>C001078</bioguideId>\\n    <fullNam ...\n[15] <cosponsors>\\n  <item>\\n    <bioguideId>C000266</bioguideId>\\n    <fullN ...\n[16] <cboCostEstimates>\\n  <item>\\n    <pubDate>2021-05-11T15:11:11Z</pubDate ...\n[17] <laws/>\n[18] <notes/>\n[19] <policyArea>\\n  <name>International Affairs</name>\\n</policyArea>\n[20] <subjects>\\n  <billSubjects>\\n    <legislativeSubjects>\\n      <item>\\n  ...\n...\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Define the output {#sec-define-output}\n\nNow we have the bill XML loaded and we've already stripped away some data we don't need but before diving deeper, it's helpful to think about the how you want to the processed XML data to be structured. For example, in the bill status data I might want to collect party-level votes. This could take the form of one row per party per bill with a column for yeas, nays, and abstentions[^7]. Perhaps I want to look at the policy areas of bills which became law. Instead of processing the entire file and then selecting the data I want, I can select only the nodes I need at the outset before transforming the data into a data frame. This will likely save you some time in cases where you have a lot of data.\n\n[^7]: For example\n\n    | Bill     | Party    | $\\cdots$ | Yeas     | Nays     | Abstentions |\n    |----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|-------------|\n    | HR-1     | R        | $\\cdots$ | 221      | 0        | 1           |\n    | HR-1     | D        | $\\cdots$ | 0        | 212      | 1           |\n    | $\\vdots$ | $\\vdots$ | $\\vdots$ | $\\vdots$ | $\\vdots$ | $\\vdots$    |\n\n    : Potential structure for party-level votes\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-page}\n\n:::\n\n\nWith the congressional bills data, I defined my output as a bill-level dataset, i.e. one bill per row, storing *nested* elements like `recordedVotes`, `committees`, and `actions` inside [list columns](https://jennybc.github.io/purrr-tutorial/ls13_list-columns.html). While columns in a data frame are typically *atomic vectors*[^8] of equal length, list columns enable us to store data of varying length and type, including data frames themselves. Using `{tidyr}`'s `unnest()` function, we can expand this nested data into regular data frame columns. Here is what this output will look like:\n\n[^8]: Atomic vectors are vectors with elements of the same type (e.g. numeric, character, etc.) as opposed to *general vectors*, or lists, which can contain a variety of types.\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-page}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<div id=\"htmlwidget-28073f69899ca75cb591\" class=\"reactable html-widget\" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"></div>\n<script type=\"application/json\" data-for=\"htmlwidget-28073f69899ca75cb591\">{\"x\":{\"tag\":{\"name\":\"Reactable\",\"attribs\":{\"data\":{\"bill_id\":[\"HR-391\"],\"bill_number\":[\"391\"],\"create_date\":[\"2021-01-22T08:12:10Z\"],\"update_date\":[\"2022-09-07T13:37:22Z\"],\"origin_chamber\":[\"House\"],\"bill_type\":[\"HR\"],\"introduced_date\":[\"2021-01-21T00:00:00Z\"],\"congress\":[\"117\"],\"constitutional_authority_statement_text\":[\"<pre>[Congressional Record Volume 167, Number 17 (Thursday, January 28, 2021)][House]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [<a href=\\\"https://www.gpo.gov\\\">www.gpo.gov<\\/a>]By Ms. SANCHEZ:H.J.

In general, this will involve the following steps:\n\n1.  Select the XML nodes you want to include in your dataset.\n2.  Convert the XML to a list.\n3.  `flatten()` the list into a data frame.\n\n::: callout-tip\n## Write Functions\n\nIf you find yourself doing similar transformations in multiple cases or copy-pasting some piece of code more than once, I would implore you to write functions because they:\n\n1.  make your code more reliable\n2.  make you think critically about how you're modifying the data\n3.  are easier to debug\n\nA good resource to start learning about writing functions is [How to Write a Function in R](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/earth-analytics/automate-science-workflows/write-function-r-programming/).\n:::\n\n# The simple case\n\nWhen converting XML into a data frame, one of the simplest cases to deal with is a set of nodes which each have a single value. You can think of singular nodes as the contents of a single cell in a data frame. When your data are entirely made up of nodes like this, you can convert XML to a data frame using two functions from `{XML}`:\n\n-   `xmlParse()` parses an XML file into an R structure[^9] representing the XML tree\n\n-   `xmlToDataFrame()` extracts data from an XML document directly into a data frame, but with limited flexibility\n\n[^9]: When you're working with both the `{XML}` and `{xml2}` libraries, it is important to note that their functions often rely on different object types. In the case of `xmlToDataFrame()`, it does not take `{xml_document}` or `{xml_node}` objects. If you try to use them, you'll see an error like this:\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    xmlToDataFrame(bill_xml)\n    ```\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n    ```\n    Error in (function (classes, fdef, mtable) : unable to find an inherited method for function 'xmlToDataFrame' for signature '\"xml_document\", \"missing\", \"missing\", \"missing\", \"missing\"'\n    ```\n    :::\n    :::\n\n\n::: callout-note\n## Note\n\nIn the example below, we need to use `getNodeSet(., [path =] \"//bill\")` to select only nodes in `<bill>`.

When parsing nested XML like this, it might require multiple steps to get the data into a [tidy data](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.html) frame.\n\nIn this case, the first step is to isolate singular elements like `billNumber` and `billType`, and deal with nested elements individually afterwards.\n\nSingular elements are nodes which meet two criteria:\n\n1.  the node does not have any child nodes of its own, and\n2.  the node is not an empty string.\n\n`xml_find_all()` finds nodes which match an [XPath](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_parser.asp) (XML Path Language) expression[^10] in a similar way as regular expressions is used to match strings. As the function's help file says, \"XPath is like regular expressions for trees\".\n\n[^10]: [A very useful table of XPath syntax](https://www.w3schools.com/XML/xpath_syntax.asp){target=\"_blank\"}\n\nIn the code below the `[` expressions within the square brackets `]` are called predicates which I use to find nodes which have no children with the XPath `count` function and nodes which are not empty strings[^11]. This returns an `{xml_nodeset}` which can be coerced to a list using `as_list()`.\n\n[^11]: In the process of writing this, I discovered that using XPath made this \\~5x faster than an equivalent function in R.\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"show\"}\n    # Function to select singular child nodes from XML node\n    xml_singular_nodes = function(xml_node){\n      # Return child nodes of current node\n      child_nodes = xml_children(xml_node)\n      # Select child nodes with 0 children\n      zero_length_child_nodes = child_nodes[xml_length(child_nodes) == 0]\n      \n      # Keep the nodes which are not empty strings\n      keep(zero_length_child_nodes, ~(xml_text(.) != \"\"))\n    }\n    ```\n    :::\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    # Using XPath:\n    # singular_nodes1 = xml_find_all(bill_xml, \n    #                                 \"//bill/*[count(./*) = 0 and not(string-length(.) = 0)]\")\n    \n    # Using R function:\n    # singular_nodes2 = xml_singular_nodes(bill_node)\n    \n    # Check they are the same\n    # all.equal(singular_nodes1, singular_nodes2)\n    \n    # benchmark the two different ways of selecting nodes\n    microbenchmark::microbenchmark(\n      xml_singular_nodes = xml_singular_nodes(bill_node),\n      xml_find_all = xml_find_all(bill_xml, \"//bill/*[count(./*) = 0 and not(string-length(.) = 0)]\")\n    )\n    ```\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n    ```\n    Unit: microseconds\n                   expr    min      lq     mean  median      uq    max neval\n     xml_singular_nodes 1040.2 1087.15 1182.637 1101.25 1131.15 7016.6   100\n           xml_find_all  200.5  211.45  231.863  220.85  242.45  463.2   100\n    ```\n    :::\n    :::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"show\" code-summary=\"Select non-empty child-less elements using XPath\"}\nsingular_nodes = xml_find_all(bill_xml, \n                              # //bill/* selects the child nodes in a bill\n                              \"//bill/*[count(./*) = 0 and not(string-length(.) = 0)]\")\n\n(singular_list = as_list(singular_nodes)) %>% \n  glimpse()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nList of 10\n $ :List of 1\n  ..$ : chr \"391\"\n $ :List of 1\n  ..$ : chr \"2021-01-22T08:12:10Z\"\n $ :List of 1\n  ..$ : chr \"2022-09-07T13:37:22Z\"\n $ :List of 1\n  ..$ : chr \"House\"\n $ :List of 1\n  ..$ : chr \"HR\"\n $ :List of 1\n  ..$ : chr \"2021-01-21\"\n $ :List of 1\n  ..$ : chr \"117\"\n $ :List of 1\n  ..$ : chr \"<pre>[Congressional Record Volume 167, Number 17 (Thursday, January 28, 2021)][House]From the Congressional Rec\"| __truncated__\n $ :List of 1\n  ..$ : chr \"Global Health Security Act of 2021\"\n $ :List of 1\n  ..$ : chr \"1.0.0\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow that we have the data we want in a list, we can flatten each element in the list into a **d**ata **f**rame **c**olumn using purrr's `flatten_dfc()`.
